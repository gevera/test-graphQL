Please fork this repository and build out the functionality described below. Here's a few things to keep in mind:

- The sandbox includes a sample SQLite database. See [here](https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-sample-database) for more information about the sample database, including a diagram of the available tables. You should only need to work with the `artists` and `albums` tables.
- The existing schema is created using `graphql-js`.
- Your schema will be a reflection of how you approach schema design. It should utilize whatever conventions and design patterns you feel are important for a production application.

Your forked repository should implement the following functionality:

- The ability to query all artists and the albums for each artist
- The ability to update an artist's name
- The ability to subscribe to changes to an individual artist
